        "You will develop an interactive Tic Tac Toe game where a human plays against a computer. The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move every time it’s its turn. This means that the computer will always play optimally, ensuring that if you both play perfectly, the game will end in a draw."

        "1. ### **Board Setup**\n",
        "    - **Board Representation:**\n",
        "        - Use a 3×3 grid (e.g., a two-dimensional array) to represent the game board.\n",

        "        - **Human Player:** Typically plays as 'O'.\n",
        "        - **Computer Player:** Plays as 'X' and uses the Minimax algorithm to decide its moves.\n",
